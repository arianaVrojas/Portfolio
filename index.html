    <img src="echo4.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <h2>ECHO series</h2>
    <p>Audacity</p>
    <p>A series done using the audio program Audacity. I used an image 
    I've done previously during highschool, and decided to add a glitch effect to this image
  as the character in my image is suppose to represent a glitch.</p>
    <img src="elmo.jpg.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <h3>HaHa</h3>
    <p>Illustrator</p>
    <p> Inspired from Barack Obama's Famous Hope poster. I wanted to Use Elmo instead as a way to parody it. I
    wanted to make it look like you should vote for elmo instead. </p>
    <img src="gotta go fast.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <h4>SpeedSenses</h4>
    <p>photoshop</p>
    <p>Inspired from the classic game Sonic The Hedgehog. I was challanged to do a remix image, which means to take something that is already done and parodying it.  For that project I wanted to make
    a hyper realistic version of the beloved stage Green Hill Zone by using real world things and combining it like a collage and making it look like the game. </p>
    <img src="art drawing 4.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <h1>Wonderland</h1>
    <p>sketchbook</p>
    <p>Fascinated by Alice in Wonderlands aethestic and theme. I wanted to make a digital artwork
    of my version as the rabbit who checks the time. But removing the colors that make wonderland
  so wonderful, and make it black and white.</p>
    <img src="art drawing 5.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <h1>untitled</h1>
    <p>Sketchbook</p>
    <p>Drawing done just by inspiration and also just to draw a character I have made who doesn't
    like to show his face. While wearing a yukata that is usually worn during Japanese festivals.</p>

  <div class="w3-third">
    <img src="COMIC1.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <h2>Don't Look At Me.</h2>
    <p>Sketchbook</p>
    <p>Inspired by one of the well known pop artist, Roy Lichenstein. I wanted to
    take my own version of comic book art mixing it with a self portrait.</p>

    <img src="Rojas.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <h1>Portrait</h1>
    <p>Sketchbook</p>
    <p>Another image og myself that I wanted to be done in a pop art style.
    I wanted to incorporate my favorite color, which is hot pink. The pose is just a normal
  pose i tend to do when I'm just bored.</p>
    <img src="Joshua.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <h1>For Joshua</h1>
    <p>Illustrator</p>
    <p>An image Ive done in rememberance to a close friend of mine, who sadly left this world too soon.
    I wanted to make an image of him in the best way I could and that being thhrough pop art. Picking a 
    pose that represented him perfectly while he was still so full of life. </p>
    <img src="ariana2.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <h1>Redrawn</h1>
    <p>Sketchbook</p>
    <p>This is a redrawn image of another older image that I have drawn previously during highschool.
    Lately I've been wanting to redraw older drawings and see how much I have imprived in my art style.</p>
    <img src="tears left for me.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <h1>Tears Left for Me</h1>
    <P>Sketchbook</P>
    <p>Me being surrounded by thorns and red roses, which symbolize to me love and maturity. I am holding one gold rose even 
    though it is withering. Representing me and the struggles I had to bare growing up.</p>
    <img src="save me.jpg" style="width:100%">
    <h1>Saved me</h1>
    <p>Skecthbook</p>
    <P>A drawing of me when I was in elementary school. Which is the time I started to draw. The things that drove me to improve in my drawings

    <h1>Freedom Fighter</h1>
    <p>Sketchbook</p>
    <P>The loved video character Sonic The Hedgehog doing what he is well known for, which is Running through green hill zone. I wanted to visualize this as a digital drawing, and make it as colorful as it is in the video game. </P>

    <h1>Onesie Series</h1>
    <p>Skecthbook</p>
    <p>I had three fun onesies that I own and I had the idea that came into my mind of "what if sonic wore these?" leading me to draw very brightly and cute digital drawings of the blue bur in my favorite onesies.</p>
